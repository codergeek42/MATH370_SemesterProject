This repository contains the code, written report (LaTeX source and associated
images), and presentation slides (LaTeX source and associated images) for our
semester project: The Steiner Tree Problem (1991). This problem is from
appendix A of the course textbook, "A First Course in Mathematical Modeling,
5th Ed." by Giordano, Fox, and Horton (ISBN# 978-1-285-05090-4).


In addition to this README, the written report, and the presentation, the
following code is submitted with this project:
	(1) Graph.py -- The Edge, Graph, and Vertex types and related functions,
		based heavily on the csuf::Edge and csuf::Graph C++ code by Dr. Kevin
		Wortman;
	(2) HananPrim.py -- The "na√Øve" solution: Create a Hanan Grid of the graph,
		and simply take the MST (using Prim's algorithm) after removing the
		"outer" 1- and 2-order vertices;
	(3) Prim.py -- An implementation of Prim's algorithm, based heavily on the
		csuf::prim C++ code by Dr. Kevin Wortman; 
	(4) SmarterPrim.py -- A modified implementation of Prim's algorithm to 
		find the MRST, by adding optimal Steiner points on-demand.
